# Node.js-Express-form-validator-mailer
Building a Node.js-Express-form-validator-mailer to use as my back-end validation for the Contact form on my porfolio website https://codebee.me. Handles the form validation and sanitization of received data and then sending an email with the submited contact message, all in the same package. Also the form data is sent to a database for testing purposes and back-up.
